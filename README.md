# Spatial medulloblastoma paper analysis code
This repository contains the code necessary to reproduce the figures from Kats, Schreiber, Simovic, et al. (in press).

The Python files in the root directory contain code that is used by multiple notebooks, such as plotting setup. The `human` directory contains notebooks for analysis of patient samples. The `pdx` directory contains notebooks for analysis of PDX samples.

The notebooks assume that SpaceRanger has been run and ingest its output.
